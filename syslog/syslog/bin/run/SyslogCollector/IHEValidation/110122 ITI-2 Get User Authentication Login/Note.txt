This directory contains schematron files for ITI-2, Get User Authentication,
login audit message.  This message specifies that the Event Type is 110122,
not ITI-2 (which would be consistent with other messages). SyslogCollector
looks up schematron using the Event Type and Event ID from the Audit message,
so this directory is named for the Event Type.
