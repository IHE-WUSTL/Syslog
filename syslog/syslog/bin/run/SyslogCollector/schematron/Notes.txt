This internet post resolved a problem in the download:

I've been continuing to deploy the "leading implementation" of
Schematron in our local environment and use it.
I ran across an apparent bug that probably ought to be fixed.
When running the stylesheet generated by iso_svrl_for_xslt2.xsl, I get
an error saying that it can't find the function document-uri().
This is because the generated XSLT stylesheet declares its version as
"1.0", but uses document-uri() which is an XSLT 2.0 function.

It is understood that this implementation may need to be tweaked for
various environments. However, it would be expected that it should work
out-of-the-box in at least one environment. But as is, it looks like it
would fail in all environments.

Here are the relevant parts of iso_svrl_for_xslt2.xsl:

<!-- Select the import statement and adjust the path as
   necessary for your system.
-->
<xsl:import href="iso_schematron_skeleton_for_saxon.xsl"/>
...
        <axsl:attribute name="document">
            <axsl:value-of select="document-uri(/)" />
        </axsl:attribute><!-- If XSLT1 remove this -->

And the relevant part of iso_schematron_skeleton_for_saxon.xsl:

    <axsl:stylesheet>
        <xsl:apply-templates select="iso:ns" />
        <!-- Handle the namespaces before the version attribute:
reported to help SAXON -->
        <xsl:attribute name="version">1.0</xsl:attribute>

In my case, I changed the version attribute's value to 2.0. I don't know
if that's the optimal fix in general.

An easy improvement at least would be to have the
        <axsl:attribute name="document">
            <axsl:value-of select="document-uri(/)" />
        </axsl:attribute>
commented out by default, with a comment <!-- If XSLT2 uncomment this -->.

Alternatively, have a variable declared in iso_svrl_for_xslt2.xsl that
iso_schematron_skeleton_for_saxon.xsl uses to set the XSLT version of
the generated stylesheet to "2.0".
After all, the "for_xslt2" in "iso_svrl_for_xslt2.xsl" presumably refers
to the generated stylesheet, since iso_svrl_for_xslt2.xsl itself uses
version="1.0".
